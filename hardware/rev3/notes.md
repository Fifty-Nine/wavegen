Notes for a future rev3
=======================

- Stacking/nesting design.
- Replace VOUT capacitor with something much smaller to decrease attenuation at higher frequencies.
- ESD suppression on the USB lines.
- Shorten USB traces, try to get the impedance closer to the spec.
- Amplifier stage (w/AGC?)
- RCA jack?
- Microcontroller-based LCD UI?
- Multiple channels?
- ADC
